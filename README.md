To-Do List App have a dynamic and responsive UI that allows you to create several to-do
lists for daily tasks and easily add or remove items from the list. For this project, I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Furthermore, the
arrangement of Bootstrapâ€™s grid system was very advantageous.
In this project, I have written JavaScript methods mainly for the following tasks: adding user
input to lists, deleting entries from lists, displaying items on the screen, etc.

This project has been made as a part of internship program offered by <b>@AscentAcademy</b>.
